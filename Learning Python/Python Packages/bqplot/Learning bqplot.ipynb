    "In this document I will outline my learning of the package [bqplot], it's own introduction states that it is based on Hadley Wickham's [Grammar of Graphics](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/jcgs.2009.07098), the paper seems to be behind a paywall but this is a neat summary from [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-grammar-of-graphics-for-effective-visualization-of-multi-dimensional-1f92b4ed4149) and another from [] although I will be working with Python for this document it should also be noted that this work is integrated into the [R](https://ramnathv.github.io/pycon2014-r/visualize/ggplot2.html) programming language; indeed, bqplot is a library which formalises these notions in a Python plotting package.\n",
    "\n",
    "The media company [Bloomberg's](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/bqplot-bringing-interactivity-data/) quantitative research team developed the library after realising that a major shortfall of the D3.js library upon which it is built is that it required a knowledge of JavaScript (which I do not have)."
