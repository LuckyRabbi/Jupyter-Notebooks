    "\n",
    "In this document I will outline my learning of the package [bqplot], it's own introduction states that it is based on Hadley Wickham's [Grammar of Graphics](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/jcgs.2009.07098), the paper seems to be behind a paywall but this is a neat summary from [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-grammar-of-graphics-for-effective-visualization-of-multi-dimensional-1f92b4ed4149) and another from [] although I will be working with Python for this document it should also be noted that this work is integrated into the [R](https://ramnathv.github.io/pycon2014-r/visualize/ggplot2.html) programming language; indeed, bqplot is a library which formalises these notions in a Python plotting package.\n",
    "\n",
    "The media company [Bloomberg's](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/bqplot-bringing-interactivity-data/) quantitative research team developed the library after realising that a major shortfall of the D3.js library upon which it is built is that it required a knowledge of JavaScript (which I do not have).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can follow the link to find the [documentation](https://bqplot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) of bqplot, which is where I will be learning the details of the library."

    "\n",
    "Each plot begins with a [Figure](https://bqplot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_generate/bqplot.figure.Figure.html), this contains a variety of objects, very similar to how matplotlib is an OO plotting library. Contained within the Figure are a number of Axes, which represent scales, these scales then further contain marks which are used to represent data in a variety of ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "The point of difference for bqplot and the reason that I am choosing to learn it is that also built-in to the figure is an **interaction object**, which allows for every aspect of the graph to be interactive. This is extremely useful for rapid prototyping and is something that I see as fundamental to good data visualisation, after all how can one expect to understand a dataset if they aren't able to play around with it?\n",

    "### **Interactions**\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code is adapted from [bqplot examples](https://github.com/bloomberg/bqplot/blob/master/examples/Interactions/Mark%20Interactions.ipynb) on github, I will be playing around with these to figure out how the interactions work. My goal is to render the bar chart that I have made for NZ net migration in bqplot with interactive bars taht display the date and the value at that time. "
