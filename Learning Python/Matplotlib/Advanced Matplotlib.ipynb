    "An important part of matplotlib are the figures and axes, when we call `plt.subplots()` or the less used `plt.figure()` what we are really doing is creating figures. The difference between these two calls is that the former creates a figure that has axes whereas the latter only creates the figure, without any axes. When a figure is made, it hangs about in memory and can be referenced easily if you know what figures are hanging around in memory.\n",

    "It must be noted that most of the plotting functions available by the by using the pyplot interface are also available for the `matplotlib.axes.Axes` class, a full list of axes [plotting functions](https://matplotlib.org/api/axes_api.html?highlight=axes%20class#plotting) are available.\n",
