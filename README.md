**Kia Ora,** 

I'm Mattias and this little document will serve as the foundation of my learning, outside of University and the work that I do, for this year. A goal that I have set myself for my Data Science development is to make a portfolio of some interesting projects that I have yet to decide. Until probably around March of 2019 I will have a fair amount of free time to work on these projects. As it stands I will hope to dedicate around 2 hours a day learning this material.
